# Discord Bot Project - Open Sourced

Welcome! This project is an early attempt at a Discord bot I created for a group, using [noblox.js](https://github.com/noblox/noblox.js) and various other libraries to ensure safety and functionality.

Since the bot is no longer in use, I'm open-sourcing it to share my journey with others who may find it helpful or interesting. Keep in mind, this was my first ever Discord bot project, and it remains unfinished. The code reflects my beginner-level knowledge of JavaScript at the time, so it may not be optimized or fully completeâ€”but I hope it can serve as a learning tool or a starting point for your own ideas!

### Key Details
- **Status:** Unfinished
- **Used Libraries:** Discord.js, noblox.js, and other libraries
